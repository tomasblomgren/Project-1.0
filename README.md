 In the gallery there are pictures of old remeniscance of both christians and Vikings who used to inhibit Sigtuna at different time periods. Runic stones describe who they where raised to. The ruins of old monasteries mark the start of a newer chapter and the seat of the first christian King which lived in Sigtuna. Olof Sk√∂tkonung was the man behind both making a more civilized society and making the first coins therefore putting Sweden on the map.
